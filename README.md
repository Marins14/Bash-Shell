- These codes I made just for increment my skills in shell script, I can't garantee that all codes will work, but I will try to make the best codes as possible =)
- The code present in the "Organizador" folder is a code that will organize your files in folders and generate a log for you, but is in portuguese, so if you want to use it, you will need to translate it to your language!
- I hope you enjoy it!
